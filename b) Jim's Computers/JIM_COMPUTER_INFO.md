# Jim's Computer Store

- This is another school assessment, this time done in Year 11.
- The brief involved another 'storefront', this time where we had to mock purchases of different computer types.
- It's written in Python and operates in the console.
- My style of writing code has changed considerably here, there is a lot of whitespace separating small blocks of code.
- That style was likely influenced by the school computers, which (compared to my laptop, where I do most of my projects now) had somewhat large screens.
