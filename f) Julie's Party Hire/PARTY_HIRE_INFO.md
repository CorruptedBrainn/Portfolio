# Julie's Party Hire

- Another assessment I did in Year 12.
- This involved creating a storefront interface to log hired and returned items.
- It is written in Python, and uses tkinter as the interface.
- There isn't a huge amount to say here, the code is messy and repetitive, and I disliked the project as a whole.
