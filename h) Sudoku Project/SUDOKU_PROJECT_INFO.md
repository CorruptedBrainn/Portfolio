# Sudoku Projet

- This was a quick project that came after I was playing some Addoku, and I wondered if it would be possible to solve any given Sudokou.
- It follows most standard rules, but there are some boards it cannot solve.
- The runtime is slow and inefficient, but since Sudoku boards are small, it isn't a huge issue.
- It's written in C++ and operates in console.
- I was originally going to implement Addoku too, but I need to create an interface for that.
