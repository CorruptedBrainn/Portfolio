> It generates a bunch of chords to form a chord progression that I can use with my compositions.
>
> The project is largely incomplete, and some of the math is broken, but the general idea is there.
>
> It also runs in console and is slow- the program was not built for efficiency.

> ### Music Lesson Notification System
>
> A project I did for NZQA's Technology Scholarship in 2024.
>
> The program looked at the recent phone ban in schools and how students were missing their music lessons, and aimed to automate email notifications for them.
>
> It works solely in Google Sheets, and created a timetabling interface to make schedulling easier to work with.
>
> Ultimately it was not adopted largely to the high learning curve.
>
> ---
>
> - Date: October 2024
> - Language: JavaScript
> - Purpose: To solve the issue of students forgetting their music lessons
> - System Requirements: Not publicly available
> - State: Stable
> - Interface: Google Sheets

> ### Sudoku Project
>
> A project I did after tunneling in on Sudoku puzzles.
>
> It operates in console, and given any sudoku grid, will solve it.
>
> ---
>
> - Date: November 2024
> - Language: C++
> - Purpose: To use common Sudoku techniques to solve puzzles.
> - System Requirements: Windows 10+
> - State: Stable
> - Interface: Console

> ### Notification System Overhaul
>
> A project I adopted to port the notification system away from Google Sheets, to an independant executable.
>
> This was done because Google Sheets was unstable and created latency issues.
>
> Ultimately I abandoned the project to focus on Competitive Programming, but the idea was to have a functional app that I could licence to other schools.
>
> ---
>
> - Date: December 2024
> - Language: C++
> - Purpose: To port my notification system project to an executable project
> - State: Abandoned
> - Interface: Dear ImGui

> ### Spacecraft Hire
>
> A school Python project I did in 2025 (Year 13).
>
> The console-based program is designed to simulate a spacecraft 'hire' interface.
>
> ---
>
> - Date: March 2025
> - Language: Python
> - Purpose: To act as an interface to simulate spacecraft hiring orders
> - System Requirements: Python 3.12+ & Windows 10+ / Linux
> - State: Final
> - Interface: Console

> ### Boroughford Interurban Railway
>
> A game I started on a few years ago as part of a team.
>
> The game aims to take Auckland, as a setting, and create a train network for others to play on.
>
> The game is hosted on Roblox, and is currently in paid access while we establish core systems.
>
> ---
>
> - Date: August 2025
> - Languages: Luau
> - Purpose: To showcase what Auckland's rail network could look like
> - System Requirements: Roblox (Mobile, PC)
> - State: Alpha Release
> - Interface: Roblox Studio

> ### The VALUE (Assessment)
> 
> A game I started working on as a school project & NZQA Technology Scholarship project.
>
> The brief was to create a game that teaches people math concepts, which I adapted (with permission) into programming concepts.
>
> The game is designed to be an open-world type game, where players program their own game elements to interact with the world, teaching them concepts such as computational geometry, data structures, and more.
>
> For this, I had to implement my own programming language (Valuescript) to give me more control with game interaction, and to allow it to fit within the game elements.
>
> This particular branch is the assessment I submitted for school. It does not include the programming language, and has the pure math question functionality.
>
> ---
>
> - Date: August 2025
> - Languages: Python, C++, Valuescript
> - Purpose: To teach players important programming concepts
> - System Requirements: Windows 11+ (x64)
> - State: Unstable
> - Interface: PySide6

## In the Future...

> ### Robotics
> 
> I currently am the programmer for one of my school's VEX V5 robotics teams.
>
> This means I program the code that makes our robot move, and allows us to compete.
>
> I'll be continuing this until the season ends, which will be early 2026.

> ### Boroughford Interurban Railway
>
> The project is still active, and we'd like to grow it further.

> ### The VALUE
>
> My goals are to get the game into a functional state, and potentially port it from Python / C++ to a full C++ program.
>
> I am still working on Valuescript as a whole. As of writing this, I have the solution file for it open in the background.
>
> I'd like the game to be in a state where I would be happy publishing it independantly.

> ### Notification System Overhaul
>
> Using what I've learnt in 2025, I think I'm capable enough to come back to this project, and turn it into something other schools can use.

> ### Random Survival
>
> A game idea I had, that acts as a choose your own adventure story.
>
> I would like to visit this, but implement it using some artificial intelligence to allow the game to adapt to the player's past and current environment.

> ### Enigma, Composition Generator, Sudoku Project
>
> I would like to pick these back up for fun, and give them proper interfaces and mechanics that would turn them into functional applications.
