# The VALUE (Assessment)

- The assessment version of the game I submitted for a school assessment in Year 13.
- The project has math questions that are randomly generated and are of varying difficulty.
- The game is unbalanced, but somewhat tested. It runs using a mixture of Python and C++, and uses PySide6 as the interface.
