# You Just Got Scammed Cinemas

- This project was a school assessment I did in Year 10.
- The brief included making a mock movie ticket purchasing program.
- The turtle script at the end was not part of the brief, but something I did out of boredom; I finished the project on the first day, so I decided to play around with turtle.
- It uses Python, and operates in the console.
- We also had free reign to choose the movie names, so the ones I put at the time were the result of a few inside jokes with my friends.
- Looking back, it's interesting how my programming style has changed since.
