# You Just Got Scammed Cinemas

- This project was a school assessment I did in Year 10.
- The brief included making a mock movie ticket purchasing program.
- The turtle script at the end was not part of the brief, but something I did out of boredom; I finished the project on the first day, so I decided to play around with turtle.
