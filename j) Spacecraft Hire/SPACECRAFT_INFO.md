# Spacecraft Hire

- A school assessment I did in Year 13.
- The task was to calculate costs for spacecraft hiring in a fictional scenario where a group of people are trvaelling in space.
- It runs in Python and uses console output.
- I used C-style functions to simulate keypresses instead of grabbing input from console to allow me to create an 'interface' in console.
- The output formats badly in IDLE. This is because of a bug inside IDLE and some of the C-stule functions I used.
