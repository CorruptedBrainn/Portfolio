# Enigma Machine

- This was my first real C++ project, aside from trivial examples that I deleted a few years back.
- Because of this, there is a noticable lack of comments and the code is very messy and untested.
- The program is in C++, and operates in console, but does access text files for data storage.
- Versions 1 and 2 are mostly similar as far as I remember. The biggest difference when I went to Version 2 was a restructuring of how I wrote the program.
- Because of this, it is likely more tested than Version 1, and the code inside is cleaner.
- It mimics an enigma machine, with working rotors and text output.
- I think it would be fun to turn this into a full application in the future when I have time. The spaghetti code in these versions is horribly inefficient.
