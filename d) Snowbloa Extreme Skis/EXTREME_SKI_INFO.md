# Extreme Skis

- An assessment I did in Year 12 for school.
- The brief was to create a form that determined eligibility for a ski club membership.
- The project was written in Python and runs in console.
- I used f-strings a lot in this project, as a way to get past default Python print formattng.
- With this though, while there are a lot of comments, it's excessive, and the spaghetti code / indentation is extreme.
- The main function is weird as well, I understand using it for C++ but for the project we were told to wrap everything in the main function, which defeats the purpose of encapsulation not polluting the global namespace-
